# Abalone-Age-Detection


Classification on Abalone dataset
What is Abalone:
A huge snail of the species Haliotis with a bowl-shaped shell that is covered in a row of breathing holes. The shell is used for decoration and as a source of mother-of-pearl, while the flesh is consumed.


Dataset Description:
The 1995 publication of the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository served as the source for the Abalone dataset. The attributes and physical characteristics of abalones, such as their number of rings, sex, length, diameter, height, and weight, are represented by each row in the dataset. The researchers visually counted the number of rings under a microscope. The number of rings plus 1.5 years of life span is used to calculate an abalone's age.

Correlation between the economic value and the age of the abalone
"Abalone is a rich nutritious food resource in the many parts of the world. The economic value of abalone is positively correlated with its age. However, determining the age of abalone is a cumbersome as well as expensive process which increases the cost and limits its popularity." Age and the economic worth of abalone are positively connected. Therefore, it's critical for both farmers and consumers to precisely estimate the age of abalone in order to set its price. It's similar to estimating a tree's age to determine an abalone's actual age. As an abalone matures, rings are typically generated in its shell at a pace of one per year. An abalone's shell must be sliced in order to reach the rings. A lab technician counts the rings on a sample of a shell after polishing and dyeing it. The researchers reasoned that rounding up the ring count by 1.5 to account for some rings that are difficult to distinguish using this technique is a reasonable estimate of the abalone's age. This intricate process raises the price and reduces its appeal. Therefore, researchers are eager in establishing a relationship between abalone length, height, and weight and age. The growers would cut costs and buyers would receive the anticipated products if a reasonably accurate model could be developed to predict the age of abalone.

The physical Process of Age Predication:
Cutting the shell through the cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings under a microscope are the tedious and time-consuming steps involved in determining the age of an abalone.
The aim of the project
We can develop a classifier that classifies the abalone's age base on all the characteristics of the abalone exept the number of rings as it is the process that makes the abalone expensive but will have 4 classes based on a threshold not the actual age number
